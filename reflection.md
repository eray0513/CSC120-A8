- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

My class represents a fairy from Pixie Hollow. Each fairy has a name, size, starts with an empty inventory (except for Pixie Dust), has a max amt of pixie dust allowed, has a current amount of pixie dust, and has an enum for a talent. I implemented an accessor method for the fairy's coordinates so I can keep track of where the fairy is, a canMove method to check if the fairy can go in a certain direction (cannot go into the negatives), and a isRemaining method to check if there is enough pixie dust for a fairy to complete a flight. What worked was starting simple and making it more complex as I got more confident with the route I was going in. What didn't work was not checking the parameters of the methods I was supposed to be implementing (I made a few incorrect methods and had to start over). The advice I would give is to make it interesting and try different things. I had fun implementing an enum class and I love fairies so it was fun to do.
